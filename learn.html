<!-- Male Sexual Health -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Male Sexual Health</h3>
<p>
Male sexual health involves the proper functioning of the reproductive organs, hormonal balance, and overall physical and psychological well-being. 
The primary male reproductive organs include the testes, penis, prostate gland, and seminal vesicles.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Testosterone plays a central role in sexual development, libido, sperm production, and muscle growth. Conditions such as erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, 
or infertility may have physical, hormonal, or psychological causes and should be evaluated by a licensed medical professional.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Female Sexual Health -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Female Sexual Health</h3>
<p>
Female sexual health includes the functioning of the ovaries, uterus, vagina, and hormonal systems. The menstrual cycle is regulated by estrogen and progesterone.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Understanding normal vaginal health, menstrual patterns, reproductive anatomy, and hormonal fluctuations is important for overall well-being. 
Irregular cycles, severe pain, or abnormal discharge should be medically assessed.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Reproductive System -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Reproductive System: Anatomy & Physiology</h3>
<p>
The human reproductive system enables reproduction through coordinated hormonal regulation and organ function. 
In males, sperm production occurs in the testes. In females, ovulation releases an egg from the ovaries.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Fertilization occurs when sperm and egg combine, leading to potential pregnancy. Understanding anatomy improves awareness and promotes safe decision-making.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Puberty -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Puberty & Hormonal Changes</h3>
<p>
Puberty is a biological process marked by hormonal changes that prepare the body for reproductive maturity. 
In males, testosterone increases muscle mass and deepens the voice. In females, estrogen regulates menstrual development.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Hormonal changes may also influence mood, emotional sensitivity, and physical growth patterns.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Safe Sex -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Safe Sex & Contraception</h3>
<p>
Contraception methods include condoms, oral contraceptive pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and hormonal injections.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Condoms are the only method that provide protection against both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). 
Using protection consistently and correctly reduces risk significantly.
</p>
</div>

<!-- STIs -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)</h3>
<p>
Common STIs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. Some infections may not show early symptoms.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Regular testing, condom use, and mutual monogamy help reduce transmission risk. Early diagnosis improves treatment outcomes.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Mental & Emotional -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Mental & Emotional Aspects of Intimacy</h3>
<p>
Sexual health is closely linked with mental and emotional well-being. Trust, communication, and mutual respect form the foundation of healthy relationships.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Anxiety, stress, or relationship issues can affect sexual functioning and satisfaction.
</p>
</div>

<!-- Consent -->
<div class="section-card">
<h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-teal-700 mb-4">Consent & Healthy Relationships</h3>
<p>
Consent must be clear, voluntary, informed, and ongoing. Silence or pressure does not constitute consent.
</p>
<p class="mt-3">
Healthy relationships are built on equality, communication, and respect for boundaries.
</p>
</div>
